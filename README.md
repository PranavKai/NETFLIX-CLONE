## System Requirements

- npm 9.0.0 or later

> **Note:** This project requires Node.js version 18.18.0 or higher. If you're using an older version, you'll need to upgrade.

## Getting Started

### Checking Node.js Version

First, check your Node.js version:

```bash
node -v
```

If your version is below 18.18.0, you'll need to upgrade using NVM (Node Version Manager) or download the installer from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

### Using NVM to upgrade Node.js

```bash
# Install NVM if you don't have it already
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# Install Node.js 18
nvm install 18

# Use Node.js 18
nvm use 18
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
